# Nandivada-Data Science Portfolio


## Portfolio Projects

This repository showcases my data science projects, including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Deep dives into datasets to uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships
- **Visualizations:** Creating compelling and insightful data visualizations to communicate findings
- **Predictive Models:** Building and evaluating machine learning models for classification and regression tasks
- **Case Studies:** End-to-end data science projects from problem definition to solution implementation

## Repository Structure

This portfolio is organized as follows:

```
.
├── eda/                      # Exploratory Data Analysis projects
├── visualizations/          # Data visualization projects
├── models/                  # Machine Learning models and predictive projects
├── case_studies/            # End-to-end project case studies
└── README.md                # This file
```

## Getting Started

Each project folder contains:
- Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and code
- Relevant datasets (or links to data sources)
- README files explaining the project objectives and key findings
